# LPMXSettingRepository
This repository contains neccesaary files for different container images

As currently [LPMX](https://github.com/jasonyangshadow/lpmx) requires dependencies to make container run correctly, this repository contains neccesaary files. 

# Notice
This repository only contains dependency file compiled for LPMX whose version is higher than `alpha-1.9.0`. Because from this version, we removed memcached dependency and started using pure file based solution.
